## Course Description
Scientific visualization creates interactive visual representations to facilitate the analysis of numerical datasets obtained through measurements or computations. The course provides an introduction to the principles of this discipline and explains the main techniques used in practice. The lectures cover the visualization of 2D, 3D, and time-dependent datasets corresponding to scalar, vector, and tensor attributes, as well as the depiction of non-spatial data. The presentation focuses on the practical role of visualization in science and engineering and is mostly self-contained. The evaluation is based on 5 programming assignments, a midterm, and a final exam. A final project may subtitutes for the final exam with the instructor's approval.
Textbook

No textbook is required. The relevant material will be provided by the instructor. Many useful references are available online. Following books are purely optional.
The Visualization Toolkit User’s Guide, Kitware Inc., ISBN 1-930934-0804 — Practical introduction to the visualization library (VTK) used in the assignments.
The Visualization Toolkit - An Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphic (3rd ed.), W. Schroeder, K. Martin, B. Lorensen, ISBN 1-930934-07-6 — VTK-centric introduction to the basic concepts of visualization. NEW: Available as PDF (free!)
Data Visualization: Principles and Practice, A. Telea, AK Peters, 2007 — General textbook on scientific and information visualization
Interactive Data Visualization, M. Ward, G. Grinstein, D. Keim, AK Peters, 2010 — General textbook on visualization with emphasis on information visualization.

## Prerequisites

CS 251 or consent of the instructor. Basic math literacy is assumed.

## Evaluation
Projects: 70% (5 x 14%)
Exams: 30% (15% midterm and 15% final)

## Projects
Each project involves a programming task to be implemented with the help of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). VTK is an open source software library that provides a versatile infrastructure for visualization. While the library itself is written in C++, it can be used in scripting languages. Both C++ and Python are available options to complete the programming tasks in this course. The evaluation considers both implementation and insightful application of the techniques to visualize a particular dataset. All projects must be completed individually!
### Submission
Each project submission must include a report with images documenting the work done as well as the code written to complete the tasks.
### Report
Word or PDF document. Note that the document must be self-contained. Online results will not be accepted.
For each task, a brief description of the proposed solution is required, along with high quality pictures of the results and accompanying discussion.
Any questions asked in the project description must be answered.
### Code
Code must be submitted in C++ (with CMake file) or Python
A README file containing detailed directions on how to run the code should be included if necessary.
### Grading Criteria
#### Task completion
Readability and clarity of the report
Quality of the images (avoid aliasing and heavy compression)

## Lateness Policy
Projects are to be electronically submitted by the due date listed on Blackboard. Each student is allowed five (5) extension days, which can be applied, without penalty, to any combination of projects during the semester. After that a late penalty of 20% per day is assigned. Use of a partial day is counted as a full day. Use of extension days must be stated explicitly in the subject line of an email to the instructor, otherwise late penalties apply. Extensions cannot be used after the final day of classes (Friday, April 27, 2018). Extension days cannot be rearranged after they are applied to a submission. Projects will NOT be accepted if they are more than five days late (regardless of whether extension days are applied to that particular assignment or not). Additional extensions will only be granted in exceptional cases (e.g., serious and documented medical or family emergencies).
## Exams
